<h2> About Me</h2>
<p style="color: #000;"> My name is Alyanna Grace Santillan. I am 24 years old, and I was born on October 18, 2001. I live in Caloocan City.
I would describe myself as someone who is pretty, confident, and proud of who I am. I believe in self-love and staying true to myself no matter what others think. I enjoy expressing myself through creativity, whether it’s in fashion, art, or simply the way I carry myself. I’m a positive thinker and always try to see the good in every situation. I value honesty, kindness, and respect, and I treat others the way I want  to be treated. I'm also a good listener and a loyal friend who’s always there when needed. As I continue to grow, I aim to become the best version  of myself—stronger, wiser, and more independent. I know I still have a lot to learn, but I’m excited for what the future holds. 
One year ago, I worked as a Customer Service Cashier at Super Value Inc. – San Lazaro Branch (SM Supermarket). I held the role of Cashier Service 10 and stayed there for 5 months. During that time, I dedicated myself to working hard in order to help support my financial needs. It was a challenging but fulfilling experience that taught me a lot about responsibility and real-life work. After finishing my time at SM San Lazaro, I immediately applied for another job and got hired at Fishermall – Malabon Branch, under Fisher Retail Inc. I continued working as a cashier for another 5 months. I truly enjoyed the experience—meeting different kinds of people, learning how to handle pressure, and improving my communication skills.
But despite enjoying my work, there was a moment when I paused and asked myself: “What do I really want for my future?” That’s when I realized how important it was to finish my college education. I knew I had to go back and focus on my studies to build a better and more stable future. Working taught me maturity and discipline—but going back to school is my way of investing in myself.

<h2> Hobbies </h2>
<p style="color: #000;"> My hobbies include playing games and creating art. I love expressing my artwork on social media, where I can share my creativity with others. As an IT student, I also enjoy combining my artistic side with technology by designing web pages and websites.
Creating designs allows me to express myself in a unique and modern way. I find joy in choosing the right colors, layouts, and visual elements that reflect my personality and ideas. Web design gives me the freedom to be both technical and creative, and that’s something I truly enjoy.
In the future, I hope to use my skills to inspire others, especially those who want to combine art and technology just like I do. I believe that creativity has no limits, and I’m excited to keep growing and learning in this field. </p>

<h2>My Family</h2>
        <p style="color: #000;">My mother’s name is Jacqueline Santillan. She is a hardworking and dedicated woman who works at J&T Express. She has always been my role model when it comes to strength and responsibility.
I have a sister named Erica Santillan, who is currently a 4th-year college student taking up BSHRM (Bachelor of Science in Human Resource Management). She’s not only doing well in her academics but also serves as the President of their Rotaract Club of University of Caloocan City —a leadership role that makes me really proud of her.
My brother, John Michael Santillan, works at J&T Express – High Value Department in the Pasig Branch. He is very focused and responsible in his job, and he’s one of the reasons I’m motivated to work hard too.
And of course, someone very special who is also part of my family is my boyfriend, Alvin Habal, who is 25 years old. He works at MRR Bill And Credit Collection Services Company as an ATL (Account Team Leader) Account Specialist. He has always supported me in everything I do and continues to motivate me to become a better person. He makes me feel loved, accepted, and appreciated for who I truly am. Of course, one of the people who has always pushed me and believed in me is my cousin, Ralph Santillan. He is a civil engineer who works in the government. He supports my school expenses and constantly encourages me to continue chasing my dreams and reaching my goals.
I am always thankful for my Kuya Ralph—not just for the financial help, but for the emotional support, motivation, and belief he gives me. His presence in my life reminds me that I’m never alone in this journey, and I will always be grateful for everything he has done for me and for my family.
I’m thankful to have a loving and supportive family. They are my source of strength, inspiration, and happiness.

<h2>Future</h2>
        <p style="color: #000;">Planning for my future is not easy—it's full of uncertainties and expectations. But one thing I know for sure is that when I finish college, my goal is to apply for a permanent and stable job. I want to use my success to give back, especially to my mother, who has worked so hard for our family. I also want to show appreciation to my boyfriend and my brother, who have supported and believed in me every step of the way.

That’s my plan for the future—to stand on my own feet and give back the love and care I’ve received. I will use my degree not just to earn a living, but to build a meaningful life and become someone my family can be proud of. I want to grow in a career where I can apply both my creativity and technical skills, especially in web design or IT-related fields.

I may not know exactly where life will take me, but I will keep working hard, stay grounded, and believe in myself. With determination and gratitude in my heart, I know I can achieve my dreams.</p>
